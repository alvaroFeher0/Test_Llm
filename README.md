# Test LLm

this repo is to learn how to make an agentic llm, giving it data and making it use functions and tune its parameters to obtain results

It includes the test code for a complement to the **JF League Manager**, the **JF Team Balancer**. 

Using LangChain and LLMs I am building a smart team balancer that fetches stats from our database to make balanced teams
